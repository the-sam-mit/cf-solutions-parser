This repo contains a small python-based implementation for web scraping using Beautiful Soup.

The python program asks for the users' codeforces handle name and the number of recent submisssions to be analyzed.
Based on the data scraped from codeforces, it creates a folder named "Submissions" and stores all your accepted recent submissions therein.

This tool was basically prepared to help me to easily record my daily submissions on Codeforces, which I would later push on to github with some basic scripting code.
This process took unnecessary time daily as I copy-pasted my code from codeforces' to github using mouse clicks. Having this tool made my life much easier. :P
